To get more results or divisions within a particular date range you can do

<% if current_user %>
<pre>GET <%= link_to api_v1_divisions_url(format: "json", start_date: "2014-08-01", end_date: "2014-09-01", house: "senate", key: current_user.api_key), api_v1_divisions_url(format: "json", start_date: "2014-08-01", end_date: "2014-09-01", house: "senate", key: current_user.api_key) %></pre>
<% else %>
<pre>GET <%= api_v1_divisions_url(format: "json", start_date: "2014-08-01", end_date: "2014-09-01", house: "senate") + '&key=[api_key]' %></pre>
<% end %>

Again this will return **at most 100** results. It is your responsibility to ensure that you are
getting all the data you expect. In practise if you receive 100 results narrow the date range or just look
at the specific house you are interested in.
